# Bad Dog! Read Me 
## Game Development Class 2016 Game Project

### The Beginning! - 9/25/2016
This marks the beginning of our project, as we start to formulate a game based on our designs
I just wanted to have fun with markdown so I decided to write the readme using it. Here's a quick cheat sheet if you want to learn right [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Version 1.0.0
We have done nothing at all! I uploaded a **sample** level design that we can use for our first duel... Here are things we need to do before then:

### Version 1.1.0
We are making progress! I updated the below list with things we have done and what still needs to be done. I'll use this to keep track of our progress.

For Development Team:

1. Player movement, left,right, jumping **DONE**
2. Player attacking, left, right, and upwards when up key is pressed (null if brawler)

3. Enemy AI + attacking
  * Enemy notices when player is within range and approaches player **DONE**
  *  Enemy attacks player

4. Stances
  * Allow player to switch between stances(This will be done using State machine for animations, and scripts to handle attributes)
  * Switching Stances affects attributes
  * Mobility Stance
  * Brawler Stance
  * Heavy Stance

7. Switching between stances (state machine will be used for animation, scripts will control attribute changes)

For Art Team

1. Main Character Sprites , start with any stance you'd like (walking left and right, jumping) **DONE**
2. Player Shooting Animation (left,right, and up)

3. Enemy Sprite - walking animation, attacking animation **DONE**

4. Heavy Stance Sprite and associated animations
5. Mobility Stance Sprite and associated animations
6. Brawler Stance Sprite and associated animations **DONE**
