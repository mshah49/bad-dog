# Bad Dog! Read Me 
## Game Development Class 2016 Game Project

### The Beginning! - 9/25/2016
This marks the beginning of our project, as we start to formulate a game based on our designs
I just wanted to have fun with markdown so I decided to write the readme using it. Here's a quick cheat sheet if you want to learn right [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Version 1.0.0
We have done nothing at all! I uploaded a **sample** level design that we can use for our first duel... Here are things we need to do before then:

For Development Team:

1. Player movement, left,right, jumping
2. Player Shooting, left, right, and upwards when up key is pressed

3. Enemy AI + shooting (which enemy will you choose to showcase?)

4. Heavy Stance 
5. Mobility Stance
6. Interactive Stance

7. Switching between stances (state machine?)

For Art Team

1. Main Character Sprites , start with interactive/balanced stance (walking left and right, jumping)
2. Player Shooting Animation (left,right, and up)

3. Enemy Sprite - walking animation, attacking animation

4. Heavy Stance Sprite and associated animations
5. Mobility Stance Sprite and associated animations

6. Background Art
7. Level Art (how the ground looks, how the platforms look, the pits etc.)

8. Boss Sprite and associated animations
